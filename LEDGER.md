- Upload to google play

FIX:
- [x] Main screen logo looking far too up — reduced marginBottom from 60 to 20
- [x] Values should be "show all" type — changed method from random to seeAll

FEATURES:
- [x] Wallpapers: Let users choose or write a phrase, generate a simple, calming, no-clutter wallpaper, and save to Photos. New tab with phrase input/picker, template selector (solids + gradients), live preview, and full-res PNG capture via react-native-view-shot + expo-media-library.

OTHER:
- Threads, Twitter posts
- Other websites (reddit, producthunt, famous threads/twitter accounts)
