- Readme with updated screenshots
- ~~Fix problems found with app store~~ Accepted! v1.0.0 live on App Store.
- ~~Check phrases inside grounding~~ Added 25 new phrases from Grupo ACT resources (breathing, body awareness, defusion, mindfulness, gratitude). All 3 languages.
- ~~Copy from resources from Rochi~~ Done. Extracted 36 images, categorized into grounding (25 phrases) and new Values mode (8 phrases). See docs/GRUPO_ACT_PHRASES.md.
- Review Spanish translations of new grounding/values phrases (machine-translated EN/PT from ES originals)
- New "Values" mode added (hidden by default) — 8 reflective ACT-based questions, random method. Existing users need to enable it in settings.

FIX:
- App Icon: Add padding. Remove top-down dark gradient.
- App name looks bad on the main screen of the phone

FEATURES:
- Wallpapers: Let users choose or write a phrase, generate a simple, calming, no-clutter wallpaper, and set it as home screen, lock screen, or both.
