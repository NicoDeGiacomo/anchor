# Self-Instructional Training (SIT)

> A summary of the psychological theory behind Anchor's phased approach to grounding.

## Overview

**Self-Instructional Training** is a cognitive-behavioral technique developed by Canadian psychologist **Donald Meichenbaum** in the 1970s. It is based on a core insight: people can change their emotional responses by modifying their internal dialogue, or "self-talk." The approach teaches individuals to replace automatic negative thoughts with structured, adaptive coping statements.

Meichenbaum originally developed the technique while treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in war veterans. It has since been applied to a wide range of conditions, including anxiety disorders, panic disorder, anger management, depression, and impulse control.

## Core Principles

### Self-Instruction

People learn to develop positive and constructive internal dialogue that helps them regulate their thoughts and emotions during moments of difficulty.

### Self-Observation

Individuals are encouraged to become aware of their own thoughts, emotions, and actions, identifying dysfunctional patterns that may be affecting their well-being.

### Self-Reinforcement

Recognizing and internally rewarding desirable behaviors and healthy coping choices. After successfully managing a difficult moment, the person acknowledges their own progress.

### Graduated Self-Instructions

Challenging tasks or situations are broken down into more manageable steps, making it easier to solve problems and make effective decisions under stress.

## Three-Phase Structure

Meichenbaum's related **Stress Inoculation Training** organizes the coping process into three sequential phases:

### 1. Preparation

The person learns to understand what is happening to them. This phase provides psychoeducation and normalization — helping the person recognize that their response (panic, anxiety, anger, sadness) is a known, temporary state that can be managed.

**Example statements:**
- "This is a panic attack. It feels terrible, but it is not dangerous."
- "Your body activated its alarm system. It will turn off on its own."

### 2. Confrontation

The person actively engages with coping statements during the stressful event. These are direct, action-oriented phrases that help maintain focus and provide a sense of control.

**Example statements:**
- "Focus on this moment. One breath at a time."
- "You have survived every panic attack before this one."
- "Strong feelings don't require immediate action."

### 3. Reinforcement

After the acute moment has passed (or the person feels they are managing it), they receive self-praise and consolidation statements. This builds confidence for future episodes and reinforces the coping behavior.

**Example statements:**
- "You handled that. You're stronger than you think."
- "Each time you face this, it gets a little easier."

## How Anchor Applies SIT

Anchor structures every mode (Panic, Anxiety, Sadness, Anger, Grounding) around these three phases:

1. **Preparation phrases** (2-4 per mode) are shown first, helping the user understand and normalize what they are experiencing.
2. **Confrontation phrases** (2-4 per mode) follow, providing active coping statements. The preparation and confrontation phases **loop continuously** as the user taps through them.
3. When the user feels ready, they press the **"I'm feeling better"** button, which triggers **reinforcement phrases** (2-4 per mode) that consolidate the coping experience, then returns the user to the main menu.

This structure ensures that users in distress receive the right type of support at the right time — understanding first, active coping during, and positive reinforcement after — following the evidence-based progression that Meichenbaum's research established.
