# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Overview

Anchor ("the app") is a free, open-source grounding app. Your privacy is a core principle — not an afterthought.

**In short: Anchor does not collect, store, or share any personal data. Ever.**

## Data Collection

Anchor does **not** collect:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Usage data or analytics
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Crash reports
- Any form of tracking or telemetry

## Data Storage

All data in Anchor is stored **locally on your device only**:

- Your custom phrases are saved on your device using local storage
- Your settings (language, theme) are saved on your device using local storage
- No data is transmitted to any server, cloud service, or third party

If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data is permanently deleted.

## Network Access

Anchor does **not** require an internet connection to function. The app works entirely offline. No network requests are made by the app at any time.

## Third-Party Services

Anchor does **not** integrate with any third-party services, including:

- No analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.)
- No advertising networks
- No crash reporting services
- No social media SDKs
- No tracking pixels or cookies

## Accounts

Anchor does **not** require or support user accounts. There is no sign-up, login, or authentication of any kind.

## Children's Privacy

Anchor does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since the app collects no data at all, it is safe for users of all ages.

## Open Source

Anchor is open source. You can inspect the complete source code at any time to verify these privacy claims:

- **Repository:** [github.com/NicoDeGiacomo/anchor](https://github.com/NicoDeGiacomo/anchor)
- **License:** MIT

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be published in the app's repository and this page will be updated with a new date.

Since Anchor's core design principle is zero data collection, any future changes would only add more detail — never reduce your privacy.
